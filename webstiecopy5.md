## THE THESIS

**If Alphabet Can Do It, So Can We**

Private capital already builds multi‑billion‑dollar holding companies:

- Alphabet · Berkshire Hathaway · SoftBank

Glenride uses the same playbook—  
but every subsidiary serves public purpose.

We’re not asking permission.  
We’re building the alternative.

## WHAT GLENRIDE IS

**A Mission‑Driven Holding Company**

We build, capitalize, and operate productive enterprises for:

- Climate resilience  
- Democratic infrastructure  
- Economic dignity  

**Our cycle:**

- **Build** — Prototype tools, platforms, and models  
- **Capitalize** — Scale what works with serious funding  
- **Operate** — Run subsidiaries that generate revenue and impact  
- **Spin Out** — Transfer successful ventures to community ownership  
- **Reinvest** — Deploy returns into the next wave of infrastructure  

Not a foundation that spends down.  
Not a nonprofit begging for grants.  
A productive engine that compounds over time.

## THE FIRST $10B

**Our Series A for the Future**

- **$3B · Climate & Energy**  
  Community microgrids, post‑carbon supply chains, revenue‑generating energy co‑ops.

- **$3B · Democratic Infrastructure**  
  Public AI platforms, data commons, governance tools licensed to cities—under community control.

- **$2B · Economic Dignity**  
  Land trusts, worker platforms, mutual aid networks that build assets, not debt.

- **$2B · Movement Capacity**  
  Training institutes, legal networks, media platforms organizers own and sustain.

Deploy within ~36 months.  
Target 30% revenue sustainability by Year 5.  
Raise the next $10B by Year 6.

## WHY SCALE MATTERS

**$10B Launches the Model. $50B+ Makes It Permanent.**

Climate adaptation needs trillions.  
Democracy and economic transformation need hundreds of billions more.

We’re not building a project.  
We’re building an institution that raises capital every few years—like any serious enterprise—to expand what works and try what’s next.

This is Round 1.

---

## HOW WE BUILD: ETHICS · CRITIQUE · PRAXIS

Every Glenride venture is grounded in:

- **ETHICS** — What does justice require?  
  Moral inquiry shapes design, ownership, and deployment.

- **CRITIQUE** — Who holds power, and how?  
  We map systems of domination before we intervene.

- **PRAXIS** — Build what doesn’t exist.  
  Ideas become infrastructure. Experiments become institutions.

## REVENUE & SUSTAINABILITY

**We’re Not Here to Spend $10B. We’re Here to Deploy It.**

- **Years 1–3:** Build — Launch ventures, prove models.  
- **Years 3–5:** Scale — Operating subsidiaries drive toward 30% sustainability.  
- **Years 5–8:** Compound — Profits reinvest; spin‑outs free capital; raise next $10B.  
- **Year 8+:** Regenerative — Revenue covers 50%+ of operations; new capital fuels expansion, not survival.

Revenue from:

- Platform and infrastructure licensing  
- Energy and service operations  
- Training and certification  
- Policy / legal framework licensing  
- Returns from community enterprises

---

## GOVERNANCE & SAFEGUARDS

**Built to Last. Built to Serve.**

- Multi‑stakeholder board: funders, community reps, movement leaders, independent ethics oversight.  
- Legal structures that block extractive acquisition.  
- Community veto power on major decisions.  
- Transparent financials and regular ethics audits.  
- Spin‑outs transfer to community ownership, with protections traveling with the assets.

---

## WHY NOW

**The Conditions Are Here. The Crises Won’t Wait.**

- Capital is looking for models beyond charity vs extraction.  
- Talent is ready to leave Big Tech and finance to build for public good.  
- Community ownership and open‑source models already work—they need scale.  
- Climate, democracy, and inequality demand institutional responses, not fragmented programs.  
- No one has built a mission‑driven holding company at this scale. Glenride will.

## ULTIMATE FRAME

“We’re not asking if this is possible.  
We’re deciding who builds it first.”

Mission‑driven holding companies are inevitable.  
The gap is obvious. The capital exists. The talent is ready.

Glenride is happening.  
The only question is whether you’ll be a founding investor.
