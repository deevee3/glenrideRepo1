Below is a first-pass information architecture and copy for **logged-in** Glenride pages. I’ll keep it conceptual (what pages exist, what they do, and example interface copy) so you and a designer/dev can turn it into flows and components.

---

## High-Level: Logged-In Experience

Once logged in, users should feel like they’ve entered a **workspace** rather than a brochure site.

Global navigation (example):

- Dashboard  
- Programs  
- Library  
- Community  
- Projects (Praxis)  
- Profile

Roles (you can expand later):  
- Member (default)  
- Scholar  
- Builder  
- Organizer  
- Partner  
- Admin (internal)

I’ll outline each core page/area.

## Next Steps We Can Do Together

We can go deeper in any of these directions:

1. **Wireframe-level detail** – For each page (e.g., Dashboard), I can specify: top hero, section order, component names, and mobile vs desktop notes.  
2. **Interaction flows** – e.g., “Apply to a Program,” “Join a Project,” “Start a New Project,” with all intermediate steps and on-screen copy (errors, success messages, tooltips).  
3. **Role-specific dashboards** – Slightly different dashboards for Scholars vs Builders vs Organizers vs Partners.

Tell me which area you want to flesh out first (Dashboard, Programs, Community, or Projects), and I’ll write the exact on-screen copy and flows for that.
