Here’s how I’d translate that UI concept into a Glenride landing experience that matches your manifesto and pillars.

---

## 1. Overall Concept

Use the same **bold, editorial hero** pattern, but instead of “READ / WATCH / LISTEN” as pure media types, anchor them to Glenride’s three pillars and core actions.

Think of the landing as a **“Future Player”**:

- **THINK** (Ethics)  
- **UNMASK** (Critique)  
- **BUILD** (Praxis)

Or, if you want to stay closer to the original:

- **READ** → Ethics  
- **WATCH** → Critique  
- **ACT** → Praxis  

Each is a “mode” visitors can switch at the top, just like tabs in the reference UI.

## 2. Hero Layout (Above the Fold)

**Structure**

- Top nav:  
  - Left: Glenride wordmark  
  - Center: Pillar tabs (READ / WATCH / ACT or THINK / UNMASK / BUILD)  
  - Right: “Join” button + minimal menu icon
- Main hero:  
  - Full-bleed image or short looping video representing the currently selected pillar.  
  - Massive, centered word overlay (e.g., “REWRITE” / “READ” / “BUILD”) in bold type, same vibe as the reference.
  - A small pill/button on the right (like the arrow in your screenshot) = primary CTA (“Enter the Movement” / “Join the Think Tank” / “Explore Programs”).

**Microcopy ideas for the black label overlay (like “Citizen on musical maturity…”)**

Rotate short, manifesto-like lines tied to the selected pillar:

- ETHICS / READ:  
  “Designing technologies for the greatest good.”  
  “What does justice look like in code, law, and streets?”
- CRITIQUE / WATCH:  
  “Tracing how power hides in our everyday systems.”  
  “From data to domination: who writes the rules?”
- PRAXIS / ACT:  
  “Prototyping the next generation of public institutions.”  
  “Where ideas become tools, cooperatives, and laws.”

## 3. Mapping Pillars into the UI

Beneath the hero, the page morphs based on the active tab, but keeps the same grid.

### READ / ETHICS

- Left: Featured essay / concept (“The Greatest Good in an Age of AI”).  
- Right: Mini cards for:
  - Ethics Labs  
  - Justice by Design Fellowship  
  - Global Ethics Dialogues  

Tag each card subtly with a label: “PROGRAM · ETHICS”.

### WATCH / CRITIQUE

- Central video or animated explainer on a live issue (e.g., “The Politics of Algorithms”).  
- Underneath, horizontally scrollable “Power Diagnostics” case studies.

Each card labeled: “INSIGHT · CRITIQUE”.

### ACT / PRAXIS

- Big headline: “Build with us.”  
- Grid of:
  - Glenride Action Incubator  
  - Policy & Movement Studio  
  - Future Systems Lab  

Each with a short 1‑sentence impact statement and a “See how it works” micro‑CTA.

Label: “BUILD · PRAXIS”.

## 4. Visual Language & Brand Feel

To keep the spirit of your inspiration but make it distinctly Glenride:

- **Color**:  
  - Background: warm neutral or muted sand (like your sample).  
  - Accent: a vivid “future” color—electric blue, ultraviolet, or emerald—for hover states and active tabs.  
- **Typography**:  
  - Huge, confident, condensed sans serif for pillar words.  
  - Clean grotesk or humanist sans for body copy.
- **Imagery**:  
  - Less “band photo,” more “movement documentary”:  
    - Faces of collaborators (with consent), labs, cities, protests, blueprints, code, diagrams.  
    - Mixed real photography with subtle glitch / overlay effects to signal “rewriting.”

## 5. Key Sections to Include After Hero

1. **One-line Positioning Strip**  
   “Glenride is a global movement and think tank engineering solutions at the intersection of ethics, critique, and praxis.”

2. **Three-Pillar Section (Horizontal or Tri-Card)**  
   Minimal cards for ETHICS / CRITIQUE / PRAXIS with one sentence each and “View programs” links.

3. **Manifesto Snapshot**  
   Pull 3–4 of the strongest lines from your manifesto in a scrolly, animated block.  
   CTA: “Read the full manifesto”.

4. **Current Focus / 2025 Agenda**  
   A band showing 3–4 thematic tracks (e.g., “Climate Futures,” “Post-Extractive Economies,” “Governance & AI”).  
   Each track cross-references programs from multiple pillars.

5. **Join Us**  
   Split layout:  
   - “For Scholars”  
   - “For Technologists”  
   - “For Organizers & Movements”  
   - “For Partners & Funders”  

   Each with tailored CTA: “Express interest,” “Propose a project,” etc.

## 6. Suggested Copy for the Hero

**Top center tabs:**  
READ · WATCH · ACT

**Main word overlay (when landing):**  
“REWRITE”

**Label:**  
“Glenride: a living ecosystem turning ideas into engineered change.”

**CTA button:**  
“Enter Glenride”

If you’d like next, I can:  
- write the exact text for each major section (hero, pillars, join section), or  
- help you turn this into a simple wireframe spec you can hand to a designer / developer (with spacing, breakpoints, and component notes).
