## 2. Three-Pillar Section

You can place this directly below the hero as three horizontal cards or a 3‑column grid.

### Section Header

**Title:**  
The Glenride Framework

**Subtitle:**  
Every Glenride initiative is grounded in three interlocking pillars—Ethics, Critique, and Praxis—so that we never lose sight of justice, power, or action.

---

### Pillar Card 1 – ETHICS (READ)

**Label:**  
ETHICS · READ

**Title:**  
Ask what the future owes us.

**Body copy:**  
Ethics is where we begin. We use rigorous, globally informed moral inquiry to question how power, resources, and responsibilities should be distributed—between people, institutions, and generations.  
We design principles that can guide real decisions about AI, climate, health, housing, and more.

**Bulleted micro-highlights (optional):**

- Ethics Labs for AI, climate, and economic justice  
- Justice by Design Fellowship for scholars and builders  
- Global Ethics Dialogues in communities and digital spaces  

**Mini CTA:**

---

### Pillar Card 2 – CRITIQUE (WATCH)

**Label:**  
CRITIQUE · WATCH

**Title:**  
Name the systems shaping our lives.

**Body copy:**  
Critique is how we see clearly. Drawing on critical theory, history, law, sociology, and lived experience, we map how domination is produced and maintained—through data, borders, markets, and myths.  
We refuse the idea that any system is neutral, inevitable, or beyond transformation.

**Bulleted micro-highlights (optional):**

- Power Diagnostics on policing, platforms, and more  
- Critical Histories of the Future projects  
- Methodologies of Liberation training for organizers and technologists  

**Mini CTA:**  
View Critique Programs →

---

### Pillar Card 3 – PRAXIS (ACT)

**Label:**  
PRAXIS · ACT

**Title:**  
Build what doesn’t exist yet.

**Body copy:**  
Praxis is where ideas become infrastructure. We co-create pilots, tools, and institutions with movements, communities, and partners—testing, refining, and scaling models that redistribute power and expand freedom.

**Bulleted micro-highlights (optional):**

- Glenride Action Incubator for mission-driven projects  
- Policy & Movement Studio linking research to law and campaigns  
- Future Systems Lab experimenting with AI, blockchain, and new governance models  

**Mini CTA:**  
View Praxis Programs →

## 3. Manifesto Snapshot Strip (Optional but Powerful)

Place this as a full-width band after the pillars.

**Section Title:**  
Why Glenride Exists

**Pull Quotes (rotating or stacked):**

- “The future is not a forecast; it is an engineered decision.”  
- “We refuse to treat crisis as the natural state of humanity.”  
- “Theory without action is abandonment. Action without theory is drift.”  
- “We are not spectators of collapse; we are engineers of transformation.”

## 4. “Current Focus / 2025 Agenda” Section

**Title:**  
What We’re Working On Now

**Subtitle:**  
Glenride’s 2025 agenda brings Ethics, Critique, and Praxis together across key fronts.

**Example track cards (edit to match your real priorities):**

1. **Climate & Extractive Economies**  
   We confront the logics of extraction—of land, labor, and data—and prototype post-extractive models of energy, finance, and community resilience.  
   *Linked programs:* Ethics Labs · Power Diagnostics · Action Incubator

2. **Governance & Artificial Intelligence**  
   We design ethical frameworks, regulatory models, and public-interest tools to ensure AI serves collective flourishing rather than surveillance or profit alone.  
   *Linked programs:* Justice by Design · Future Systems Lab · Policy & Movement Studio

3. **Borders, Belonging & Migration**  
   We examine how borders are built and enforced, and co-create new practices of sanctuary, mobility, and membership.  
   *Linked programs:* Critical Histories · Methodologies of Liberation · Action Incubator

**CTA:**
