## 1. About Glenride

**Purpose:** Give new visitors a clear, high-level understanding of what Glenride is and why it exists.

### Page Title
About Glenride

### Hero Section

**Headline:**  
Rewriting the future is a collective discipline.

**Subheading:**  
Glenride is a global movement and think tank founded by D’Vaughn House, dedicated to engineering solutions at the intersection of ethics, critique, and praxis.

---

### Section 1 – What Glenride Is

**Headline:**  
A think tank. A build space. A movement.

**Body:**  
Glenride brings together scholars, technologists, organizers, artists, and communities who believe the future is not a forecast but an engineered decision.

We refuse to accept crisis as the default state of humanity. Instead, we design and test new frameworks, tools, and institutions that serve the greatest good—especially for those most harmed by existing systems.

Glenride operates as:

- **A research engine**, where rigorous thinking about ethics and power is central, not peripheral.  
- **A build space**, where ideas evolve into prototypes, pilots, and policies.  
- **A movement network**, where people across borders and disciplines organize around shared values.

---

### Section 2 – How We Work

**Headline:**  
From insight to infrastructure.

**Body:**  
Our work moves through a deliberate cycle:

1. **Ethics** – Clarifying what justice, responsibility, and the “greatest good” mean in concrete contexts.  
2. **Critique** – Diagnosing how domination, inequality, and extraction are built into our institutions and technologies.  
3. **Praxis** – Co-creating interventions that redistribute power and expand freedom.

Every Glenride program, partnership, and publication is mapped to these three pillars so that we never lose sight of values, power, or action.

---

### Section 3 – Origins

**Headline:**  
Created by D’Vaughn House.

**Body:**  
Glenride began as a response to a simple question:  
*What would it look like if we treated the future as something we intentionally engineer for justice, rather than something we passively inherit?*

Drawing on a background that bridges rigorous analysis, data integrity, and systems thinking, D’Vaughn House created Glenride as a foundation for people who wanted more than commentary—people who wanted to build.

Today, Glenride is evolving into a global ecosystem of collaborators who share that commitment.

---

### Section 4 – What We Focus On

**Headline:**  
Crises we refuse to normalize.

**Body:**  
While Glenride’s tools are broad, our attention is precise. We concentrate on overlapping crises such as:

- Climate breakdown and extractive economies  
- Racial segregation, economic exploitation, and mass displacement  
- Gendered and sexual oppression  
- Political violence, algorithmic harm, and democratic erosion  

We approach these not as isolated “issues,” but as interconnected systems that can—and must—be redesigned.

## 2. Pillars & Programs

**Purpose:** Show how the three pillars translate into concrete initiatives.

### Page Title
Pillars & Programs

### Hero

**Headline:**  
From principles to programs.

**Subheading:**  
Glenride’s work is structured around three pillars—Ethics, Critique, and Praxis. Each pillar hosts programs that move us from understanding to transformation.

---

### Section 1 – ETHICS

**Label:**  
Pillar I · Ethics

**Short Description:**  
Ethics is our starting point. We investigate what justice requires in contexts shaped by AI, climate crisis, global inequality, and more. We craft frameworks that can guide real-world decisions, not just abstract debates.

**Programs (sample drafts you can rename later):**

1. **Ethics Labs**  
   *Collaborative studios where philosophers, technologists, and affected communities design ethical guidelines and evaluation criteria for emerging technologies and public policies.*

2. **Justice by Design Fellowship**  
   *A fellowship for scholars and builders who embed ethical reflection into systems—product design, governance models, legal frameworks, and data infrastructures.*

3. **Global Ethics Dialogues**  
   *Open conversations and workshops that bring complex ethical questions into accessible public forums, online and in-person.*

---

### Section 2 – CRITIQUE

**Label:**  
Pillar II · Critique

**Short Description:**  
Critique helps us see clearly. We examine how power operates—historically and today—in law, markets, data, borders, and everyday life. We refuse the myth of neutral systems.

**Programs:**

1. **Power Diagnostics Initiative**  
   *Deep-dive research projects that map how power and harm move through specific systems—policing, housing, migration, education, digital platforms—and identify leverage points for change.*

2. **Critical Histories of the Future**  
   *Projects that uncover suppressed or forgotten histories to expand what futures we can imagine and claim, especially for marginalized communities.*

3. **Methodologies of Liberation School**  
   *Training in critical methods for students, organizers, policymakers, and technologists who want to interrogate and transform the systems they’re in.*

---

### Section 3 – PRAXIS

**Label:**  
Pillar III · Praxis

**Short Description:**  
Praxis is where insight meets responsibility. We co-design and test concrete interventions—from policies to platforms to cooperative models—with communities and partners.

**Programs:**

1. **Glenride Action Incubator**  
   *An incubator for mission-driven projects—apps, cooperatives, campaigns, and civic tools—that emerge from our Ethics and Critique work.*

2. **Policy & Movement Studio**  
   *A collaborative space where researchers, lawyers, organizers, and designers translate analysis into legislation, charters, institutional reforms, and movement strategies.*

3. **Future Systems Lab**  
   *An experimental lab using AI, distributed ledgers, and other technologies to design new forms of governance, mutual aid, and economic coordination.*

---

### Sample Q&A

**Q1. Is Glenride an academic institution, a nonprofit, or a company?**  
**A.** Glenride is a hybrid think tank and build space. We work with universities, community organizations, and partners across sectors, but our core commitment is to build an ecosystem—not a single institution. As we grow, we may use different legal structures in different regions to best support our mission.

---

**Q2. Do I need a specific degree or background to participate?**  
**A.** No. We welcome scholars, technologists, organizers, artists, and people whose expertise comes from lived experience and community work. Some fellowships or programs may have specific criteria, but the Glenride movement itself is open.

---

**Q3. How do you decide which projects to support?**  
**A.** We prioritize projects that:  
- Address structural issues rather than surface symptoms  
- Are grounded in clear ethical reflection and critical analysis  
- Are co-created with, or accountable to, affected communities  
- Have a plausible path from prototype to real-world impact  

---

**Q4. How is Glenride funded?**  
**A.** We aim to blend philanthropic support, values-aligned partnerships, and potentially member-driven models over time. Our goal is to protect intellectual and political independence while remaining materially accountable to the communities we serve.
